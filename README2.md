## Vanced Alternatives (taken from [_here_](https://gist.github.com/SkyyySi/1b621c7c20ae7e0865a8ac428156c1cf#file-youtube-vanced-alternatives-md). Credits to @SkyyySi)
NONE OF THESE CLIENTS ARE VERIFIED BY ME FOR SECURITY OR ANYTHING ELSE! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

These are the current alternatives (with links when possible):
 - [NewPipe](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases) (which you should have either way for youtube-dl/yt-dlp integration)
   - [NewPipe fork by polymorphicshade](https://github.com/polymorphicshade/NewPipe) (includes sponsor block)
 - [LibreTube](https://github.com/libre-tube/LibreTube/releases) (still in early beta)
 - Firefox with uBlock Origin, enhancer for youtube, SponsorBlock and return youtube dislike -> install an addon compatible fork like [IceRaven](https://github.com/fork-maintainers/iceraven-browser), then install the addons from the adddon store
   - [Some alternatives that include Kiwi, uBlock, SponsorBlock and many more!](https://gist.github.com/SkyyySi/1b621c7c20ae7e0865a8ac428156c1cf?permalink_comment_id=4096512#gistcomment-4096512)
 - YouTube Pink -> [I have no legit link yet]
 - YouTube++ (iOS) -> [I have no legit link yet]
   - Alternative: [uYouPlus](https://github.com/qnblackcat/uYouPlus)
 - [SkyTube](https://github.com/SkyTubeTeam/SkyTube/releases)
 - [MusicPiped (F-Droid; YT Music alt.)](https://github.com/deep-gaurav/MusicPiped/releases)
   - Alternative: [YMusic](https://ymusic.io/)
 - [AdAway](https://github.com/AdAway/AdAway/releases) (requires root to work full, but no-root DNS mode is also available) ! ONLY WORKS FOR YT WEB !
 - [VueTube](https://github.com/Frontesque/VueTube), a very new client.

If you want to save videos offline using scripting, you can use [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) running in [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app).

Also, there's [xManager-Spotify](https://github.com/xManager-v2/xManager-Spotify/releases) for... Spotify as a replacement for Vanced Music. I would advise you to not use this with a premium account though, since ad blockers are a TOS violation and can get your account suspended. That won't really matter in practice if you just use throw-away accounts though (I'm not a lawyer, so don't quote me on that)

As for what I think are the best ones: Either NewPipe (has some nice features like support for other platforms like SoundCloud and a complete downloader) or the Web version with add-ons (which will give you the most complete experience, including login).

Some things that may or may not work are most popular video players, but they won't allow discovery (except for possibly Kodi)

Finally a pro-tip: If you want to download videos from any YT app, you can install NewPipe and share the link to the video to it from the share-menu. Then you can select to always download when sharing to NewPipe.

If you want a copy on Discord or you know another App I should add, just DM me ðŸ‘Œ
